# The Complete JavaScript Course Projects

Modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step.

## Project 1 : Guess My Number

I made this mini game project for learn and project practice about DOM Manipulation. (Vanilla JavaScript. )

- Game generqates a random number between 1-20.
- You should 'guees' the randomly generated number, as least tries as possible.
- Every 'wrong' guess costs you 1 point from your score.
- Game keeps your "High Score" as long as you keep playing the game.

## Project 2 : Modal Window

A set of experimental modal window appearance with JavaScript.
According to the code I wrote with Javascript, you can press x to close the window.You can close the window by pressing the parts outside the window and you can also close it by pressing the esc key.

## Project 3 : Pig Game

This is a dice game .
If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

## Project 4 : Alarm Clock

In this Alarm Clock, there is a digital clock that shows the current time along with some alarm options hour, minutes, am/pm. Users can select a time and set alarms for any time, whether AM or PM. If youâ€™re already familiar with JavaScript Date() object, then this alarm code will be easy for you to understand.

## Project 5 : Snake Game

I have created a Snake game using JavaScript. The game is simple and addictive, where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The objective of the game is to collect as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game features multiple levels of difficulty and can be played with both keyboard and touch controls. Developing this game helped me improve my skills in JavaScript, especially in working with event listeners, game logic, and animations.

## Project 6 : Palindrome Checker

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sentence that reads the same backward as forward, Eg. level, borrow or rob, 1234321. In my palindrome checker, users can enter text or numbers and check whether the entered value is palindrome or not by clicking on the check palindrome button.

### Conclusion

This tribute website provides a platform for fans to engage by leaving messages and supporting the artist through donations. The project demonstrates proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation, as well as the ability to create an aesthetically pleasing and interactive web interface.
